## How to Contribute

The website for this project is built with [Zola](https://www.getzola.org), a Rust based static site generator that
makes it easy to build websites without indepth coding experience.

You'll need to install the Zola CLI tool first, to test the website locally (your PC) before making requests (to make
sure everything is all set)

1. **Install Zola**:
    - Follow the installation instructions for your operating system (Windows, Linux, macOS).
    - [Zola Installation Guide](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/installation/)

2. **Write Markdown**:
    - Contributions should be in Markdown format.
    - Don't know Markdown format? You can write on Editors like Notion and Paste it here, or you can use
      this [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to Learn.
    - If you don't want to go through that just create an issue and Link the document.
    - Ensure you include the necessary fields at the top of your file.

3. **Add Necessary Fields**:
    - Example of required fields:
   ```markdown
   +++
   title = "Your Title Here"
   date = "YYYY-MM-DD"
   author = "Your Name"
   description = "A brief description of the topic"
   +++
   ```

4. **Write Your Contribution**:
    - Provide clear and concise content relevant to the topic.
    - Please keep it short, simple, informative and avoid unnecessary Jargon.

    - [Markdown Lint Documentation](https://github.com/markdownlint/markdownlint)

6. **Making a Pull Request (PR)**:
    - Once your contribution is ready, submit a PR for review.
    - One of the contributors would merge the pull request in no time if everything is right.
