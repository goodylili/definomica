# Contributing to Definomica

Thank you for considering contributing to Definomica! We welcome all types of contributions, from improving
documentation to proposing new features. Here’s a guide to help you get started:

## How to Contribute

First, you need to setup your environment with the following tools. Check
out [SETUP.md](https://github.com/goodylili/definomica/blob/main/setup.md) for the series of steps you need after
reading this document.

Definomica's website is powered by [Zola](https://www.getzola.org), a static site generator built with Rust, designed to
make website creation simple. Before making any contributions, you’ll need to install Zola on your local machine to test
the site.

### 1. Install Zola

- Follow the installation instructions for your operating system:
    - [Zola Installation Guide](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/installation/)
- Verify the installation by running Zola locally to ensure your changes work as expected.

### 2. Write Your Contribution in Markdown

- Contributions should be made in Markdown format. If you’re unfamiliar with Markdown, you can use editors like Notion
  to draft your content and paste it into a Markdown file.
- Need help with Markdown? Check out the [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/).
- Alternatively, create an issue with your draft attached if you’re unsure about Markdown formatting.

### 3. Include Required Metadata Fields

- At the top of your Markdown file, include the following fields:
    ```markdown
    +++
    title = "Your Title Here"
    date = "YYYY-MM-DD"
    author = "Your Name"
    description = "A brief description of the topic"
    +++
    ```

### 4. Content Guidelines

- Keep your contributions clear, concise, and relevant.
- Avoid jargon; make the content accessible to a broad audience.
- Keep it short and to the point while providing value.

### 5. Linting with Markdown Lint

- Before submitting, run your Markdown file through a linter to ensure it’s properly formatted.
- Use [Markdown Lint](https://github.com/markdownlint/markdownlint) to catch any syntax issues.

### 6. Submitting a Pull Request (PR)

- Once you’re satisfied with your changes, submit a PR for review.
- Ensure your PR clearly describes what changes you’re proposing.
- We review PRs promptly, so expect feedback or merging soon.

## General Contribution Process

1. **Browse Existing Issues and Discussions**  
   Start by reviewing ongoing issues or discussions. This is a great way to see where your skills might be most useful.
   If you're unsure where to start, look for issues tagged as "good first issues" or "bugs."

2. **Choose Between Issues and Discussions**
    - Use **Discussions** for proposing new features, changing processes, or collaborating on a larger design.
      Discussions usually evolve into one or more issues.
    - Use **Issues** for reporting bugs, proposing specific edits, or making concrete suggestions.

3. **Participate in Discussions**  
   Thoughtful contributions to ongoing discussions can help shape the project’s future. Engage with other contributors
   to refine ideas before starting work.

4. **Working on an Issue**
    - Ensure that the issue you’re interested in has been approved.
    - If someone else is already working on the issue, reach out to see if collaboration is possible.
    - If no one is assigned, comment to let others know you’re working on it.

5. **Submit a Pull Request (PR)**
    - Once your work is ready, follow standard GitHub practices to submit a
      PR. [Pull request guidelines](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/setting-guidelines-for-repository-contributors).

We look forward to your contributions to Definomica! Together, we can make DeFi education and innovation even better.
