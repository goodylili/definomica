Thank you for considering making contributions to the Definomica!

Contributing to this repo can mean many things, from participating in discussion to proposing changes and edits.

To ensure a smooth workflow for all contributors, the general procedure for contributing has been established:

- Start by browsing new issues and discussions. If you are looking for something interesting or if you have something in
  your mind, there is a chance it had been discussed.
    - Looking for a good place to start contributing? How about checking out some good first issues or bugs?
- Determine whether a GitHub issue or discussion is more appropriate for your needs:
    - If want to propose something new that requires specification or an additional design, or you would like to change
      a process, start with a new discussion. With discussions, we can better handle the design process using discussion
      threads. A discussion usually leads to one or more issues.
    - If the issue you want addressed is a specific proposal, a bug or an edit, then open a new issue.
    - Review existing issues to find an issue you'd like to help with.
- Participate in thoughtful discussion on that issue.
- If you would like to contribute:
    - Ensure that the proposal has been accepted.
    - Ensure that nobody else has already begun working on this issue. If they have, make sure to contact them to
      collaborate.
    - If nobody has been assigned to the issue, and you would like to work on it, make a comment on the issue to inform
      the community of your intentions to begin work.
    - To submit your work as a contribution to the repository follow standard GitHub best practices.
      See [pull request guideline](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/setting-guidelines-for-repository-contributors).
